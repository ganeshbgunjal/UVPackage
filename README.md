UV is a modern Python package manager created by Astral, the team behind Ruff.

Think of it as a super fast alternative to:

    pip (installing packages)

    virtualenv (creating isolated environments)

    pip-tools (dependency resolution)

Itâ€™s kind of like Poetry, but focused more on speed, simplicity, and modern tooling.

Commands for installing UV: 
    1. pip install uv
    2. uv init uvdemo       #this is folder in project.
    it will create necessory files bydefault. this is so fast.
    3. uv venv              #to create virtul environment
    4.
